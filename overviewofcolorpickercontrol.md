#### Overview of ColorPicker control {#overview-of-colorpicker-control style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

The ColorPicker control provides an easy and an efficient way to select colors, from the color palette collection. It displays the color palette as a drop-down control. It is supplied with two varieties of visualization, for viewing the colors from the palette. The selected color is highlighted with its respective name. For example, if the brown color is selected, then the tooltip will display the tooltip text as \"Brown\". ColorPicker also comes with the support of eyedropper to fetch colors for the ColorPicker, from any sections of your application.

This section also discusses about the ColorEdit control, which is similar to the ColorPicker control.
