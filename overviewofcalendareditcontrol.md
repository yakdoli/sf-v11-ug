#### Overview of CalendarEdit control {#overview-of-calendaredit-control style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

The CalendarEdit control provides implementation of DateTime values in a calendar form. It therefore supports full range of dates, allowed by that object. Effectively, any date ranging from year 0 to year 9999 A.D. can be displayed. It displays a calendar through which the users can navigate to any day in a selected year. Its template can be easily modified just like any other WPF control. It is added with in-built animation to navigate between months.
