#### Calculation Engine {#calculation-engine style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

Essential XlsIO has a calculation engine of its own and can compute the values of the formula entered during runtime. Essential Calculate is now \[from v9.1.x.x\] integrated with Essential XlsIO, and thus makes it possible to get the values of the formula entered by using XlsIO during runtime, without any additional references or packages. Currently there are over 180+ functions that are supported by this Calculate engine, which cover all common usage scenarios.
