This feature enables the user to implement Office 2007 AND Office 2010 UI. It exposes most of the features of the new UI and keeps intact with the WPF architecture. Configuring and designing the layout is very easy through XAML code. RibbonWindow has been implemented to provide themed Office 2007 UI or Office2010 UI appearance for the traditional window. Full functionality of keyboard navigation and Keytips are provided for faster access to items present in the ribbon. Enhanced tooltips helps the users to get into the application very easily.
