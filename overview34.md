Presently in Windows phone, native data binding (binding within the application) is used. The input/data that is given is contained within the application or entered at runtime by the user.Â  WCF Data binding is the process of populating the data/items inside the internet dynamically, when the page/control is being loaded. WCF Data Binding requires an internet connection to load the items. It works by configuring the service reference in the client side application.
