#### Rearranging the elements in an axis {#rearranging-the-elements-in-an-axis style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

 

Usually the elements in an axis will be are stacked in the Axis Element Builder one below another as they are dropped. We can rearrange it by using the popup menu that will appear when we place the mouse over the element.

This popup menu will contain three menus namely:

[·      ]{style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"}Up -- By clicking this button, the selected element will be moved one position up from its current position.

[·      ]{style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"}Dow -- By clicking this button, the selected element will be moved one position down from its current position.

[·      ]{style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol"}Delete -- By clicking this button, the selected element will be removed from the current axis.
