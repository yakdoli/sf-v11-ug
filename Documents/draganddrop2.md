##### Drag and Drop

 

Drag and Drop functionality of DockingManager allows you to dock a control at any position or float it using Mouse. This can be achieved using Drag Providers.

When you click the caption bar and hold the Mouse Left Button, and if you start dragging the window, Drag Providers will appear at the center of the mouse hovered window. Outer Drag Providers will also appear at the four sides. If the mouse is moved over one of the drag indicator, a shadow will appear indicating where the window will be docked if we release the mouse. If the mouse is released over the center indicator, window will then be tabbed with mouse hovered window.

Window can be made to float if the mouse is released anywhere other than over the Drag Providers. To learn more about Drag Providers, refer[ ]{style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 14pt"}[[]{.UGHyperlink}[Drag Providers]{.UGHyperlink}[]{.UGHyperlink}]{.UGHyperlink}[]{.UGHyperlink}[ ]{.UGHyperlink}topic.

[Autohide and Hide]{#_Ref261394107}

A window can be autohidden using the Awl button on the Header of a window. If you click this button window will be autohidden. When the mouse is hovered over the autohidden tab, autohidden window will be displayed to view and if you again click on the Awl button window will be docked. If you click the cross button on the header of a window, it will be hidden from view. We can bring it back to view by changing its DockState.
