### Formatting {#formatting style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

Conditional Formatting

Conditional Formatting feature allows you to apply formats to a cell or range of cells depending on the value of cells or formulas that meet specific criteria.

 

Number formatting

Using the number formatting feature, you can change the appearance of a number or value in a cell. This number formatting does not change the actual number, but just change the way it appears in the cell. This feature improves the appearance of the spreadsheet and makes the numbers easier to read and understand.

 

Cell formatting

Cell formatting feature allows you to change font style for the data you entered into the cells. The color and size of the fonts, cell backgrounds, and cell borderss can also be changed using this feature.

 

Merge cells

Using this feature, you can merge two or more adjacent cells into a single cell and display the contents of one cell in the merged cell. You can also merge the contents of multiple cells and display them in one cell.

 

Data Validation

Data validation feature helps you to ensure the data integrity by enforcing end users to enter valid data into the cells. You can also write your own input message that appears before entering data; it helps the users to acquaint with valid data. You can also write an error message that appears in case of any invalid data entered.

 

Copy and Paste

Spreadsheet control allows you to copy the data or formulas from one or more cells and paste them to other cells in the same worksheet, or in different worksheets.

 

Fill series

Spreadsheet control has the support for fill series as like in Microsoft Excel. By using the fill series feature, you can automatically fill the data based on the pervious cells. This control also features copy series and fill with/without formatting supports as like in Excel.
