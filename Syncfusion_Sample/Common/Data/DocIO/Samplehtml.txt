			<P>HTML is the <EM>lingua franca</EM> for publishing hypertext on the World Wide 
				Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon
				<ABBR title="Standard Generalized MarkUp Language">SGML</ABBR>, and can be 
				created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain text editors 
				- you type it in from scratch- to sophisticated
				<ACRONYM title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</ACRONYM>
				authoring tools. HTML uses tags such as <CODE>&lt;h1&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/h1&gt;</CODE>
				to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc. Here 
				is a <A href="Guide/">10-minute guide</A> for newcomers to HTML. W3C's 
				statement of direction for HTML is given on the <A href="Activity">HTML Activity 
					Statement</A>. See also the page on our work on the <A href="Forms/">next 
					generation of Web forms</A>, and the section on <A href="historical">Web

			<H2><A id="whatis-xhtml" name="whatis-xhtml">What is XHTML?</A></H2>
			<P>The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML™) is a family of current and 
				future document types and modules that reproduce, subset, and extend HTML, 
				reformulated in <A href="../XML/">XML</A>. XHTML Family document types are all 
				XML-based, and ultimately are designed to work in conjunction with XML-based 
				user agents. XHTML is the successor of HTML, and a <A href="#recommendations">series 
					of specifications</A> has been developed for XHTML. See also: <A href="2004/xhtml-faq">

			<H2><A id="mission" name="mission">Mission of the HTML Working Group</A></H2>
			<P>The mission of the <A href="Group/">HTML Working Group</A> (<A href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/AccessRequest">members 
					only</A>) is to develop the next generation of HTML as a suite of XML tag 
				sets with a clean migration path from HTML 4. Some of the expected benefits 
				include: reduced authoring costs, an improved match to database &amp; workflow 
				applications, a modular solution to the increasingly disparate capabilities of 
				browsers, and the ability to cleanly integrate HTML with other XML 
				applications. For further information, see the <A href="../2002/05/html/charter">Charter</A>

			<P>W3C produces what are known as "<A href="../2004/02/Process-20040205/tr#RecsW3C">Recommendations</A>". 
				These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and then reviewed by 
				Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation indicates that consensus has 
				been reached among the Consortium Members that a specification is appropriate 
				for widespread use.</P>

			<H3><A id="xhtml1" href="../TR/xhtml1" name="xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</A></H3>
			<P>XHTML 1.0 is the W3C's first Recommendation for XHTML, following on from <A href="#previous">
					earlier work</A> on HTML 4.01, HTML 4.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0. With a 
				wealth of features, XHTML 1.0 is a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML, and 
				combines the strength of HTML 4 with the power of XML.</P>
			<P>XHTML 1.0 is the first major change to HTML since HTML 4.0 was released in 1997. 
				It brings the rigor of XML to Web pages and is the keystone in W3C's work to 
				create standards that provide richer Web pages on an ever increasing range of 
				browser platforms including cell phones, televisions, cars, wallet sized 
				wireless communicators, kiosks, and desktops.</P>
			<P>XHTML 1.0 is the first step and the HTML Working Group is busy on the next. 
				XHTML 1.0 reformulates HTML as an XML application. This makes it easier to 
				process and easier to maintain. XHTML 1.0 borrows elements and attributes from 
				W3C's earlier work on HTML 4, and can be interpreted by existing browsers, by 
				following a few simple <A href="../TR/xhtml1/#guidelines">guidelines</A>. This 
				allows you to start using XHTML now!</P>
			<P>You can roll over your old HTML documents into XHTML using an Open Source <A href="#tidy">
					HTML Tidy</A> utility. This tool also cleans up markup errors, removes 
				clutter and prettifies the markup making it easier to maintain.</P>
			<H4><A id="flavors" name="flavors">Three "flavors" of XHTML 1.0:</A></H4>
			<P>XHTML 1.0 is specified in three "flavors". You specify which of these variants 
				you are using by inserting a line at the beginning of the document. For 
				example, the HTML for this document starts with a line which says that it is 
				using XHTML 1.0 Strict. Thus, if you want to validate the document, the tool 
				used knows which variant you are using. Each variant has its own DTD - Document 
				Type Definition - which sets out the rules and regulations for using HTML in a 
				succinct and definitive manner.</P>
			<P><STRONG>XHTML 1.0 Strict</STRONG> - Use this when you want really clean 
						structural mark-up, free of any markup associated with layout. Use this 
						together with W3C's Cascading Style Sheet language (<A href="../Style/CSS/">CSS</A>) 
						to get the font, color, and layout effects you want.</P>
			<P><STRONG>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</STRONG> - Many people writing Web pages for the 
						general public to access might want to use this flavor of XHTML 1.0. The idea 
						is to take advantage of XHTML features including style sheets but nonetheless 
						to make small adjustments to your markup for the benefit of those viewing your 
						pages with older browsers which can't understand style sheets. These include 
						using the <CODE>body</CODE> element with <CODE>bgcolor</CODE>, 
			<CODE>text</CODE>
						and <CODE>link</CODE> attributes.</P>
			<P><STRONG>XHTML 1.0 Frameset</STRONG> - Use this when you want to use Frames to 
						partition the browser window into two or more frames.</P>
			<P>The complete <A href="../TR/xhtml1">XHTML 1.0 specification</A> is available in 
				English in several formats, including HTML, PostScript and
				<ABBR title="Portable Document Format">PDF</ABBR>. See also the <A href="../TR/xhtml1,translations">
					list of translations</A> produced by volunteers.</P> <!--

			<H3><A id="html4" href="../TR/html4" name="html4">HTML 4.01</A></H3>
			<P><A href="../TR/html4">HTML 4.01</A> is a revision of the HTML 4.0 Recommendation 
				first released on 18th December 1997. The revision fixes minor errors that have 
				been found since then. The XHTML 1.0 spec relies on HTML 4.01 for the meanings 
				of XHTML elements and attributes. This allowed us to reduce the size of the 
				XHTML 1.0 spec very considerably.</P>
			<H3><A id="xhtml-basic" href="../TR/xhtml-basic" name="xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic</A><br>
&nbsp;</H3>
			<P>XHTML Basic is the second Recommendation in a series of XHTML specifications.</P>
			<P>The XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be 
				an XHTML Host Language document type, and in addition it includes images, 
				forms, basic tables, and object support. It is designed for Web clients that do 
				not support the full set of XHTML features; for example, Web clients such as 
				mobile phones,
				<ABBR title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</ABBR>s, pagers, and settop boxes. 
				The document type is rich enough for content authoring.</P>
			<P>XHTML Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. For example, an 
				event module that is more generic than the traditional HTML 4 event system 
				could be added or it could be extended by additional modules from XHTML 
				Modularization such as the Scripting Module. The goal of XHTML Basic is to 
				serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents.</P>
			<P>The document type definition is implemented using XHTML modules as defined in "<CITE><A href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization 
						of XHTML</A></CITE>".</P>
			<P>The complete <A href="../TR/xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic specification</A> is 
				available in English in several formats, including HTML, plain text, PostScript 
				and PDF. See also the <A href="../TR/xhtml-basic,translations">list of translations</A>

			<P><EM><STRONG>Note.</STRONG> To reflect errata and subsequent developments, such as 
					XML Schemas, work on <A href="../TR/2004/WD-xhtml-modularization-20040218/">Second 
						Edition of "Modularization of XHTML"</A> is currently in progress.</EM></P>
			<P>Modularization of XHTML is the third Recommendation in a series of XHTML 
				specifications.</P>
			<P>This Recommendation specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML and an 
				implementation of the abstraction using XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs). 
				This modularization provides a means for subsetting and extending XHTML, a 
				feature needed for extending XHTML's reach onto emerging platforms.
			</P>
			<P>Modularization of XHTML will make it easier to combine with markup tags for 
				things like vector graphics, multimedia, math, electronic commerce and more. 
				Content providers will find it easier to produce content for a wide range of 
				platforms, with better assurances as to how the content is rendered.</P>
			<P>The modular design reflects the realization that a one-size-fits-all approach 
				will no longer work in a world where browsers vary enormously in their 
				capabilities. A browser in a cellphone can't offer the same experience as a top 
				of the range multimedia desktop machine. The cellphone doesn't even have the 
				memory to load the page designed for the desktop browser.</P>

			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<H3><A id="xhtml11" href="../TR/xhtml11" name="xhtml11">XHTML 1.1 - Module-based XHTML</A></H3>
			<P>This Recommendation defines a new XHTML document type that is based upon the 
				module framework and modules defined in Modularization of XHTML. The purpose of 
				this document type is to serve as the basis for future extended XHTML 'family' 
				document types, and to provide a consistent, forward-looking document type 
				cleanly separated from the deprecated, legacy functionality of HTML 4 that was 
				brought forward into the XHTML 1.0 document types.</P>
			<P>This document type is essentially a reformulation of XHTML 1.0 Strict using 
				XHTML Modules. This means that many facilities available in other XHTML Family 
				document types (e.g., XHTML Frames) are not available in this document type. 
				These other facilities are available through modules defined in Modularization 
				of XHTML, and document authors are free to define document types based upon 
				XHTML 1.1 that use these facilities (see Modularization of XHTML for 
				information on creating new document types).</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<H4><A id="differences" name="differences">What is the difference between XHTML 1.0, 
					XHTML Basic and XHTML 1.1?</A></H4>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<P>The first step was to reformulate <A href="#html4">HTML 4</A> in XML, resulting 
				in <A href="#xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</A>. By following the <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines">
					HTML Compatibility Guidelines</A> set forth in Appendix C of the XHTML 1.0 
				specification, XHTML 1.0 documents could be compatible with existing HTML user 
				agents.</P>
			<P>The next step is to modularize the elements and attributes into convenient 
				collections for use in documents that combine XHTML with other tag sets. The 
				modules are defined in <A href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</A>.
				<A href="#xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic</A> is an example of fairly minimal build of 
				these modules and is targeted at mobile applications.</P>
			<P><A href="#xhtml11">XHTML 1.1</A> is an example of a larger build of the modules, 
				avoiding many of the presentation features. While XHTML 1.1 looks very similar 
				to XHTML 1.0 Strict, it is designed to serve as the basis for future extended 
				XHTML Family document types, and its modular design makes it easier to add 
				other modules as needed or integrate itself into other markup languages. <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/appendixa.html#parsing.module">
					XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0</A> document type is an example of such XHTML 
				Family document type.</P>
