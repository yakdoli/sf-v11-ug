<h1>Digital Signature</h1>
<p>Essential PDF supports the signing of both existing and new documents.</p>
<p> In general, digital<strong> </strong> signatures are used to authenticate 
the identity of a user and a document’s content. It stores information about the signer and the state of the document when it was signed. When enterprises distribute documents electronically, it is often important that recipients can verify:</p>

<ul>
<li>That the content has not been altered (integrity).</li>
<li>That the document is coming from the actual person who was supposed to send 
it (authenticity).</li>
<li>That an individual who has signed the document cannot deny the signature (non-repudiation).</li>
</ul>

<p>Digital signatures address these security concerns by providing greater assurance of document integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation.</p>
<h3>
    Features:</h3>
<ul>
<p>A PDF document may contain the following standard types of signatures.</p>
 <ul>
	<li><strong>One or more document (or ordinary) signatures - </strong>These signatures are sometimes referred to as recipient signatures. If a signed document is modified and saved by incremental update, the data corresponding to the byte range of the original signature is preserved. If the signature is valid, it is possible to recreate the state of the document as it existed at the time of signing.</li>
	<p></p><li><strong>A single Modification Detection and Prevention (MDP) signature 
	-</strong> This signature is also referred to as an author or a certifying signature.</li></p>

<p><strong>Steps involved in signing a document:</strong></p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Map the path of the certificate store.

<code><pre>
//Get certificate 
PdfCertificate pdfCert = new PdfCertificate(@"..\..\Data\PDF.pfx", "syncfusion");
 
//Sign the document in the image      
signature = new PdfSignature(page, pdfCert, "Signature");
bmp = new PdfBitmap(@"..\..\Data\syncfusion_logo.gif");
signature.Bounds = new RectangleF(new PointF(5, 5), bmp.PhysicalDimension);

//Set the Author signature
signature.Certificated = true;
</pre>
</code>
<p>2)&nbsp; Set the signature display properties.</p>

<code><pre>
// Set signature Info.
signature.ContactInfo = "johndoe@owned.us";
signature.LocationInfo = "Honolulu, Hawaii";
