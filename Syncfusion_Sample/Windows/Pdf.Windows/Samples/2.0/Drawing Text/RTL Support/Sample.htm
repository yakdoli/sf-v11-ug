<h1>RTL Support</h1>

<p>
    Essential PDF has support for drawing RTL languages into a PDF document.    </p>

<h3>
    Features</h3>
<ul>
    
<p>
Middle Eastern languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, are written predominantly from  right to left. 
However, their numbers are written with the most significant digits to the left, just as in European or other left-to-right text. </p>
<p>Languages written in left-to-right scripts are often mixed in, so the complete document is bidirectional in nature, a mix of both right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) writing. Text written in the Hebrew and Arabic languages are often referred to as bidirectional, or "bidi" for short. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Note: </b>Text alignment has to be set as <em>right </em>to make the RTL text right aligned.</p>


<p>Here is an image of the output.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/RTL.png" alt="PDF" title="" /></div>

<p>Here is a code snippet used to modify text alignment:</p>
<pre>
//Set font with unicode option
Font f = new Font( "Arial", 14 );
PdfFont font = new PdfTrueTypeFont( f, true );

//Set the format for string
PdfStringFormat format = new PdfStringFormat();

//set the format as RTL type
format.RightToLeft = true;

//Set the alignment
format.Alignment = PdfTextAlignment.Right;

//Draw the RTL text
page.Graphics.DrawString( text, font, brush, rect, format );
</pre>
</ul>
