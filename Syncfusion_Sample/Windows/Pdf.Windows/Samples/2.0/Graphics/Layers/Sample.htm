    <p>
	Layers are virtual plates associated with one page. They are stored in separate PDF structures. Each layer has its own graphics, which can be accessed through 
the 
<strong>Graphics</strong> property. You may insert or append layers, which allows 
you to draw new graphic objects underneath existing layers. The <strong>Layers</strong> 
property was created to enable you to access the layer collection of a page.</p>

<p>This sample focuses on demonstrating the creation of layers in Essential PDF.</p>

<p>Below is an image of the output.</p>
<div align=center><img src="images/layers.png" alt="PDF" title="" /></div>

<p>Here is the code snippet used to insert layers in a PDF document:</p>
<pre>
//Add the first layer
page.Layers.Add();

//Set it as default layer to draw the graphic elements
PdfGraphics graphics = page.DefaultLayer.Graphics;

//Draw Arc 
graphics.DrawArc(pen, rect, 360, 360);

//Add another layer on the page
page.Layers.Add();

//Increment the layer
page.DefaultLayerIndex += 1;
graphics = page.DefaultLayer.Graphics;
        
//Draw another set of elements
pen = new PdfPen(Color.Red, 50);
graphics.DrawArc(pen, rect, 360, 360);

</pre>
