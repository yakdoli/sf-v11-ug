<html><h1>Printing</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates the <strong>printing</strong> support in the edit control. It also demonstrates the use of print dialog, print preview, and 
the headers-footers features.</p>

<p>The edit control provides complete support for printing its contents. You can 
either print the entire document, just the current page, specific pages, or certain selected text 
only. The printing implementation is very similar to the ones available in standard applications such as Microsoft Office or Visual Studio.NET. </p>
<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
