<p>This sample illustrates the implementation of a <b>Custom Code Editor</b> 
using Syncfusion Menus and the edit control. This sample also illustrates the various 
features of edit control.</p>
<p>Essential Edit offers fully configurable <strong>Syntax Highlighting </strong>for general text 
editing purposes. Syntax highlighting greatly improves the 
readability of any text, and has found its way into many commercial 
applications. Syntax highlighting is accomplished in Essential Edit through the 
use of XML-based configuration files. </p>
<p>Configuration files control how Essential Edit interprets and displays text. 
The configuration files also support language-based syntax coloring of embedded 
scripts. If requirements are more complex, our syntax configuration model will 
easily allow customization of the configuration file to meet any requirements.</p>
<p>We have predefined configuration files for languages like C#, VB.NET, SQL, 
HTML, XML, Java, JScript, VBScript, Delphi, and plain text. We plan to create 
more configuration files for other languages in the near future. All the 
predefined configuration settings are present in the <b>Essential 
Edit.Configurator.KnownLanguages</b> collection. It is possible to set Essential Edit to use any of the predefined configuration settings 
by using the 
<strong>ApplyConfiguration</strong> method. </p>
<p>Essential Edit also supports a <strong>Configuration Editor</strong> for customizing 
configuration settings at run time.</p>
