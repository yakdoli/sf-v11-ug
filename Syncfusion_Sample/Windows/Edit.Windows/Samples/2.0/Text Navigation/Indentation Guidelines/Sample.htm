<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Essential Edit has one of the most powerful and intelligent bracket highlighting and indentation guidelines features. The matching brackets and indentation guidelines can be highlighted using custom colors.</li>

<p>Essential Edit is also capable of supporting language domains that have multiple languages, such as HTML or XML. Moreover, it understands that for each language, different brackets can be defined for highlighting. For example, in C#, curly braces should be highlighted, while in HTML or XML, angled braces (for tags) are defined to be highlighted instead.</p>

	<li>Essential Edit also supports navigation between the start and end 
	positions of an indentation block. It is also possible to optionally highlight only the matching brackets without the indentation guidelines.</li>
</ul>
