<html><h1>Intellisense from XML</h1>


<p>This sample illustrates the edit control's support for populating the <strong>
Context Choice </strong> list and the 
<strong>Context Prompt</strong> using a XML file. A different set of context choice and context prompt items are displayed based on the word (or lexeme) invoking the respective context choice and context prompt pop-ups. </p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Context Choice</strong> support allows the creation of pop-ups for displaying a list of options used to complete 
	a word the user is typing. The list of options displayed in the Context Choice list can be populated from a XML file. 
	This feature is modeled on the &quot;<b>List Members Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio and is very convenient when editing programming languages.<p>It is also possible to auto-complete 
	the word by using up or down arrow keys to chose the Context Choice item and pressing the 
	<strong>Tab</strong> key. The Context Choice pop-up can be dismissed by 
	pressing the <strong>Esc.</strong> key.</p>

<p><div align=center><img src="images/ContextPrompt.png" alt="ContextPrompt Image" title=""></div></p>


	<li>The <strong>Context Prompt</strong> feature allows the creation of pop-ups for displaying variations of syntax or overloads or method signatures. The pop-ups can be populated using a XML file that contains the  variations of syntax or overloads or method signatures. 
	This feature is modeled on the &quot;<b>Parameter Info Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio. Each of the Context Prompt items can have a syntax <em>specifier</em> 
	string and text message, providing additional information on each item. The 
	user is able to scroll through the syntax variations either by using the up 
	or down arrow keys or by clicking on the up or down buttons on the pop-up.</li>
