<html><h1>Advanced IntelliSense</h1>

<p>This sample illustrates the support for the I<strong>ntelliSense</strong> feature in Essential Edit. It also shows how you could add context-based configuration settings to Essential Edit's configuration file, 
dynamically in code. Another feature this sample demonstrates is the ability to 
bold the current parameter to be input to the Context Prompt pop-up.</p>

<p>The IntelliSense support in Essential Edit mainly consists of the Context Choice, the Context Prompt, and the Context ToolTip features. </p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>Context Choice</b> support allows the creation of pop-ups for 
	displaying a list of options used to complete whatever the user is typing. This 
	feature is modeled on the &quot;<b>List Members Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio and is very convenient when editing programming languages. It 
	is also possible to auto-complete a word by using up or down arrow keys and 
	to choose the Context Choice item and pressing the <strong>Tab</strong> key. The Context 
	Choice pop-up can be dismissed by pressing the <strong>Esc.</strong> key.</li>
	<br><br><li>The <b>Context Prompt</b> feature allows the creation of pop-ups for 
	displaying variations of syntax or overloads or method signatures. This 
	feature is modeled on the &quot;<b>Parameter Info Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio. Each of the Context Prompt items can have a syntax <em>specifier</em> 
	string and text message, providing additional information on each item. The 
	user is able to scroll through the syntax variations either by using the up 
	or down arrow keys or by clicking on the up or down buttons on the pop-up.</li>
	<br><br><li>The <b>Context ToolTip</b> displays ToolTips with helpful information 
	when the mouse is hovering over a word in Essential Edit. This feature is 
	modeled on the &quot;<b>Quick Info Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in Visual Studio. 
	Whenever the mouse hovers over a word, the Context ToolTip is updated and 
	if some text information is provided, it is displayed in a ToolTip. </li>
</ul>
