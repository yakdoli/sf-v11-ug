<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>Context Choice</b> support allows the creation of pop-ups for 
	displaying a list of options used to complete what the user is typing. This 
	feature is modeled on the &quot;<b>List Members Intellisense</b>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio and is very convenient when editing programming languages. It 
	is also possible to auto-complete a word by using up or down arrow keys and to choose the Context Choice item and pressing the 
	<strong>Tab</strong> key. The Context 
	Choice pop-up can be dismissed by pressing the <strong>Esc.</strong> key.</li>
	The items in the context choice can be either filtered or navigated. <br><br>Refer 
	to the above figure in which a context choice item is filtered and navigated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>Context Prompt</b> feature allows the creation of pop-ups for 
	displaying variations of syntax or overloads or method signatures.<b> </b>
	This 
	feature is modeled on the &quot;<strong>Parameter Info Intellisense</strong>&quot; feature in 
	Visual Studio. Each of the Context Prompt items can have a syntax <em>specifier</em> 
	string and text message, providing additional information on each item. The 
	user is able to scroll through the syntax variations either by using the up 
	or down arrow keys or by clicking on the up or down buttons on the pop-up.</li>
	<br></li>
