<html><h1>Code Snippets</h1>

<p>A <strong>code snippet</strong> is a fragment of code or text that you can store in a XML file and reuse at a later time. The 
edit control offers support for code snippets in Visual Studio 2005. This includes the ability to load and save VS.NET 2005-compatible XML snippet files. The highlighted field indicates to the user the data that is to be entered to complete the code snippet. Code snippets can be inserted into the 
edit control by typing the snippet name and pressing the <strong>Tab</strong> key. Code snippets can also be inserted using the 
<strong>Ctrl + `</strong> combination.</p>
