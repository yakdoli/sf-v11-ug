<html><h1>Syntax Coloring</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates the language-based <strong>Syntax Highlighting</strong> feature of Essential Edit, including examples containing embedded scripts. It also lets you view the predefined configuration settings for the mentioned list of languages. Moreover, it illustrates the use of 
the<strong> Configuration Editor</strong> to dynamically customize syntax highlighting features at run time. </p>

<p>Essential Edit offers fully configurable syntax highlighting for general text editing purposes. Syntax highlighting greatly improves the readability of any text and has found its way into many commercial applications. Syntax highlighting is accomplished in Essential Edit through the use of XML-based configuration files. Configuration files control how Essential Edit interprets and displays text. The configuration files also support language-based syntax coloring of embedded scripts. If requirements are more complex, our syntax configuration model will easily allow customization of the configuration file to meet any requirements.  </p>
