<html><h1>Font Customization</h1>

<p>This sample illustrates dynamic run-time<strong> font customization </strong>support in the 
edit control. The font customization in the edit control works slightly differently from the regular text processing control. The font customization can only be done at the 
format level and not at a word level or selected-text level. The edit control is more of 
a text parsing-syntax highlighting control, and less of a text editing control.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<p>Essential Edit fully supports font customization for text and provides two approaches for 
doing so. </p>

<UL><Li>The first approach is to use the configuration file and customize the font settings using 
	font, style, and font color fields in the <strong>Format</strong> tag definition. <br></Li><br><Li>The second one is to use the 
	<strong>Formats Customization Editor</strong> at run time to set the desired font, font style, and font color to the various text formats. <br>Moreover, Essential Edit also works fine with non mono-space fonts. </Li></UL></p>
