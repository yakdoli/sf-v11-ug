<html><h1>Status Bar</h1>

<p>The<strong> status bar</strong> is a component often found at the bottom of windows in a graphical user interface. It is very frequently divided into sections, each of which show different information. Its job is primarily to display information about the current state of its window, although some status bars have extra functionality. For example, many 
Web browsers have clickable sections that pop up a display of security or privacy information.</p>

<p>This sample illustrates the built-in <strong>Status Bar</strong> feature in the 
edit control. The status bar in the edit control can be optionally hidden or shown. It hosts a 
number of specialized status bar panels like <strong>Text Panel</strong>, 
<strong>Status Panel</strong>, <strong>Encoding Panel</strong>, <strong>Coords Panel,</strong> and 
<strong>Insert Panel,</strong> which provide specific information about various aspects of the 
edit control application. The text associated with each of these status bar panels can be customized and each of the 
them can be optionally hidden or shown. The status bar also hosts a sizing gripper, which can be optionally hidden or shown as well.</p>
