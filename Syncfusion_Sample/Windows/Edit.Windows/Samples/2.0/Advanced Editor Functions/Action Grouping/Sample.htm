<html><h1>Action Grouping</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates how you could group a set of actions as one entity, and then undo or redo these actions using one single 
<strong>Undo</strong> or <strong>Redo</strong> method call. Run this sample and open an action group using the <strong>ActionMenu</strong>. Perform a set of actions on the 
edit control, and close the action group. Now you can undo or redo these actions using the 
<strong>Undo-Redo</strong> menu items in the <strong>Action</strong> menu.</p>

<p><h3>Features :</h3></p>

<p><ul><li>The default edit control in Windows Forms supports just one level of undo-redo operations, whereas Essential Edit supports multiple levels. </li>

<li>The <strong>Undo</strong> and <strong>Redo</strong> methods are used to accomplish undo and redo operations, respectively. </li>
<li>This can also be accomplished with default keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y key combinations.</li>. 
<li>It also supports action grouping which allows the users to specify a set of actions as groups for undo-redo purposes.</li> 
<li>When an action group is created and a set of actions is added to it, the entire set is considered as one entity.</li>
<li>It has methods such as <strong>UndoGroupOpen</strong>, <strong>UndoGroupClose</strong>, and <strong>UndoGroupCancel</strong>, to programmatically manipulate the undo-redo action grouping.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h3>Interactive Features :</h3></p>
<p><ul><li>Click Action Menu and select Open Group menu item.</li>
<li>Modify the text more than once in EditControl.</li>
<li>Click Action Menu and select Close Group menu item</li>
<li>Click Action Menu and select Undo menu item and the modified text will be removed.</li>
<li>Click Action Menu and select Redo menu item and the removed text will be replaced.</li>
