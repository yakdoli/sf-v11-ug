<p><div align=center><img src="images/ColumnGuidesDemo.png" alt="ColumnGuides" title="" /></div></p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Column guides are desired by users to indicate certain columns that have special meaning. For instance, in certain languages (like in Cobol), no text should appear past column 80; hence, it will be useful for the editor if a line is displayed, which indicates the location of column 80.</li>
	<li>Essential Edit supports an unlimited number of column guides. Each column guide can have a custom color and location.</li>
	<li>Locations can be specified by a column (calculated based on the type and size of the font being used in Essential Edit). 
	</li>
</ul>
