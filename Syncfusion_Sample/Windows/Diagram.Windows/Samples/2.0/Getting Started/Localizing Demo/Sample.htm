<h1>Localization Demo</h1>
<p>Essential Diagram lets you customize built-in dialogs for a specific culture. 
This involves building custom-resource .dll files for specific cultures, as 
explained in this online help topic:
<a href="http://help.syncfusion.com/ug_71/diagram/LocalizationSupport.html">
Localization Support</a>.</p>

<p>This screenshot shows the typical display for a localized Header-Footer dialog.</p>
<div align=center>
  <img src="images/sample.png" alt="Localizing Dialog" title=""/></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> The German translation is executed based on tools found online; Syncfusion 
does not guarantee the accuracy of the translation.</p></html>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p class="style1">This sample illustrates the localization of the various diagram dialogs such 
as the Header-Footer dialog, Page Borders dialog, Print Setup dialog, and Layout 
dialog. For example, in this sample, the diagram dialogs are localized for the 
German culture.</p>
<p class="style1"><b>Note: </b><br></p>
<li class="style1">The German resource .dll files are copied to the <strong>bin</strong> folder 
in the following location: <strong>..\bin\debug\de-DE</strong>. </li>
<li class="style1">The localizable property of the form is set to <em>true</em>.</li>
<li class="style1">To ensure that this sample application's thread runs in a German culture, 
even if the OS's regional settings are not set to German, you must explicitly 
set <strong>CurrentUICulture</strong> as follows (before the <strong>
InitializeComponent()</strong> method): </li>
