<html><h1>State Diagram</h1>

<p>The state diagrams are used to give an abstract description of the behavior of a system. 
This behavior is analyzed and represented in series of events that could occur in one or more possible states. Hereby, "each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and tracks the different states of its objects through the system".
</p>
<p>The state diagrams can be used to graphically represent finite state machines.</p>
