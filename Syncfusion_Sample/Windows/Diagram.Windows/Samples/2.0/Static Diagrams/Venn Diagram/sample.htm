<html><h1>Venn Diagram</h1>

<p>Venn diagrams or Set diagrams are diagrams that show all possible logical relations between finite collections of sets (aggregation of things).</p>
<p>The Venn diagrams normally comprise overlapping circles. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the elements of the set, while the exterior represents the elements that are not members of the set.</p>
