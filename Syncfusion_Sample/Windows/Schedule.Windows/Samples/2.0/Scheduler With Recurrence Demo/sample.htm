<p><p>This sample uses a schedule control on a form. It also has menu items that illustrate various properties and settings of the 
schedule control. It loads a sample 
&quot;<strong>Appointments</strong>&quot; file that holds appointments. </p>
<p>The data provider is <strong>ArrayListDataProvider </strong>whose implementation is found in the 
<strong>Syncfusion.Schedule</strong> namespace. In addition, this data provider uses appointment objects that implement the
<strong>IRecurringScheduleAppointment</strong> interface to allow you to use recurring appointments in the sample.</p></p>

<p>As mentioned, this sample supports recurring appointments. When you edit an existing appointment, or enter a new one, you have the option to make the appointment a recurring appointment by clicking the 
"Make Recurring" button on the <strong>Enter Appointment</strong> screen. Clicking this button will pop up an "Appointment Recurrence" dialog box, in which you can specify the recurring definition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is an image displaying these dialogs.</p>
