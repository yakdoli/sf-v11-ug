<H1>Retirement Simulation Demo</H1>
<P>This sample illustrates the usage of 
<STRONG>GridFormulaEngine.NamedRanges</STRONG> method in a grid control. The
sample allows you to enter parameters, such as retirement age and
initial savings, and then computes the age at which you would run out
of funds during retirement; this is based on either inflation or
investment return assumptions that you enter. It will also perform a
Monte Carlo-type simulation, using random adjustments to your base
assumptions, to estimate the probability of running out of funds
at certain intervals.</P>

	value to zero, so that values in the grid will match values
