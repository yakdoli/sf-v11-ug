<h1>Pivot Grid Demo</h1>

<p>This sample simulates the pivot table feature of Excel. The pivot grid, as 
the name implies, pivots data through the drag-and-drop operation, to organize the data in a 
cross-tabulated form. The major advantage with pivot grid is that you can extract 
the desired information from a large list within seconds. Along with presenting the data, it also enables you to summarize and group data. It finds its main application in 
the financial domain, where it is used to organize and analyze business data.</p>

<p>The pivot grid comprises of the following components.</p>

<p><ul><li><b>Display Grid</b> - Displays the data extracted from the underlying database.<br><br>
<li><b>Pivot Table Field List</b> - Lists the available fields from the database. 
Provides a way to add/remove the fields to/from the grid. <br><br>
<li><b>Drag-Drop Areas</b> - Serves as a view state of the pivot grid, where you can rearrange the fields by doing a drag-and-drop 
operation between the row and column label areas.</ul></p>
