<P> Essential Grid has an extremely high-performance standard. It can
handle very high frequency updates and refresh scenarios. It also
offers complete support for Virtual Mode wherein the data will be
loaded only on demand. By simply setting a few properties, you can have
the grid work with large amounts of data without a performance hit.

<P>The different
samples that illustrate the performance of Essential Grid are
listed below:</P>
