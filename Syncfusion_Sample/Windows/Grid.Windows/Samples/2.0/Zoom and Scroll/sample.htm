<P>Essential Grid supports interactive features like zooming and scrolling.  It
supports zooming at the cell and grid level with and without in-built support. You can also use detached
scrollbars with Essential Grid. Thus, you can drop scrollbars on
your form and tell a grid to use them instead of the
grid&rsquo;s standard scrollbars. 
</P>
<P>The different
demo samples that illustrate the zooming and scrolling properties of
Essential Grid are listed below:</P>
