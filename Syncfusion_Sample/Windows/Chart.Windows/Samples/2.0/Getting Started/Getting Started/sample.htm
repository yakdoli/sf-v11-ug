<html><h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This sample illustrates how to get started quickly by populating a chart with data points and configuring it with common settings.</p>

<p><div align =center> <img src="images/sample.png" alt="Chart Getting Started Sample" title="" /></div></p>
<p><div align=center><TABLE>
		
		<tr><td style="height:5"> </td></tr>
		</TABLE></div></p>

<p>The chart control used in this sample is dragged and dropped from the toolbox 
onto the form. A set of series is then created and added to the chart control.</p>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>
	<p><b>Creating a series</b></p>
<p>This chart series was created using the following code.</p>
<font color="#8D2E1C"><pre><code>
ChartSeries series = new ChartSeries("Series 1");
series.Points.Add(0, 500);
series.Points.Add(1,340);
series.Points.Add(2,240);
series.Points.Add(3,440);
series.Type = ChartSeriesType.Column;
series.Text = series.Name;
</code></pre></font>


<p>The above code creates a series with four points, sets the chart type, and assigns a name to the series.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Adding a series to a chart</b></p>
<p>The above series was added to the chart as follows:</p>

<font color="#8D2E1C"><pre><code>this.chartControl1.Series.Add(series);</code></pre></font>

<p>Similarly, three different series were created and added to the chart.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Customize Chart</b></p>
<p>Basic customization of the appearance and behavior of the chart area, legend, 
and axes occurs in the <strong>InitializeControlSettings</strong> method.</p></li></ul>
