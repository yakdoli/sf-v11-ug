<h1>Huge Data in Multi-Chart</h1>
<p>This sample shows how selections in a high-level view can be expanded to a
low-level view<strong> </strong>when they are bound to large data.</p>

<p><div align =center> <img src="images/sample.png" alt="Huge Data In Multi Chart Views" title="" /></div></p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<p class="style1">The top chart shows the entire set of 100,000 data points while the bottom 
chart shows a subset of the points based on the selection in the top chart.</p>
<p class="style1">Both charts are bound to a custom-data model that automatically compresses 
(by averaging) multiple chart points into one; this makes it possible to plot all 
the points within the available chart space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="style1">The custom-data model automatically increases or decreases this compression ratio as the chart's size changes because of resizing or zooming.</p>
