<html><h1>GDBG Field Chooser Demo</h1>

<p><p>This sample demonstrates how to use a plug-in utility called <strong> Field Chooser,</strong> 
which will help you customize the view of a grid&nbsp; based on column visibility.   
</p>

<LI><P>The <strong>GridDataBoundFieldChooser</strong> class of a GridDataBoundGrid has been 
implemented to add or remove columns from a grid. This implementation is simple, 
which is performed by declaring the class where the constructor takes a parameter 
as a GridDataBoundGrid object.</p>

<UL>
	<LI><P>Right click on a column header and select the Field Chooser menu item to view the <STRONG>Field Chooser dialog</STRONG>.</P>
<LI><P>This dialog will list all the column names with check boxes adjacent to them.</P>
<LI><P> The columns visible in the 
grid will be checked; un-checking a box makes a column disappear.</p>

<p><p>Here is a code snippet used to implement the class of the Field Chooser:</p></p>

<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>
		GridDataBoundFieldChooser fChooser = new GridDataBoundFieldChooser();
                fChooser.WireGrid(this.GridDataBoundGrid1);
 </pre></font></p>
<p><p>Here is a code snippet used to UnWire the Field Chooser:</p></p>
<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>		
                fChooser.UnWireGrid();
 </pre></font></p>
