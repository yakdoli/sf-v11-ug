<p>This sample shows how HTMLUI can be used to develop complex game<strong>
</strong>applications.</p>

<p><p align=center><img src="images/sample.png" alt="HTMLUI TicTacToe " title="" /></p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The HTML document contains a table in it. The table entries are decided by the user at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong> game logic is implemented by accessing the position where the user clicks on the control.</p></li>
<li><p>On the execution of the <strong>Click</strong> event, the logic decides whether the X or O is to be placed in the element&#8217;s text.</p></li>
<li><p>If the same text is placed along the diagonal or along the same line, the sample changes the color of the element and steps out of the code.</p></li>
</ul>
