<div align=center><img src="images/sample.png" width="591" height="433"/></div>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>HTMLUI supports linking to various documents either from the user drive or from a URI, which helps in developing user friendly applications like bookmarking, referencing, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>HTMLUI allows the use of <strong>Tab</strong> key shortcut to navigate through the links, and 
the <strong>Enter</strong> key to open the link that is focused.</p></li>
<li><p>Images instead of text can be used in the HTMLUI control as links to the other files.</p></li>
<li><p>Another important feature that HTMLUI provides with links is that the user can decide the course of action forwarded by the link after being clicked, with the help of the HTMLUI control's <strong>LinkClicked</strong> Event.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The loaded file contains links to other documents. The HTMLUI control will 
allow you to navigate through the links in the HTML page.</p/
