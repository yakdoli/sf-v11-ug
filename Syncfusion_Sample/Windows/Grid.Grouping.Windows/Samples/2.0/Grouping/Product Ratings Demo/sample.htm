<html><h1>Product Ratings Demo</h1>

<p><p>This sample shows a Products table where each product has a rating from multiple customers. This sample shows how to swap the 
Products and the Ratings tables so when grouped by rating, the sample will assign the 
Ratings table as the main data source, and it will add a foreign-key relation to the 
Products table. This will allow the products with multiple ratings to appear more than once.&nbsp; 
This is similar to Microsoft Outlook's &#8220;Group By Category&#8221; feature, where one e-mail item can belong to multiple categories.

<p>Given below an image of the sample.</p>
