<html><h1>Grouping Events Demo</h1>

<p>This sample demonstrates the creation of an event log that will show the 
order of various grouping events that are fired. You will be able to see different grouping events like 
Group Added, Group Expanded, Group Collapsed, etc. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first step is to create an event tracer and customize it by adding 
	the required event handlers. The <strong>GridEngine</strong> class is used 
	for this purpose. By using an instance of this class, the event handlers are 
	generated. In this sample, the <strong>EngineEventTracer</strong> is implemented, which contains two methods: <strong>HookEvents</strong> and 
	<strong>UnHookEvents</strong>. These events hook-up the events on demand and 
	unhook them when they are not  traced. </li>

<p>The following is an image of the sample.</p>

<p><p align=center><img src="images/sample.png" alt="Grouping Events screenshot" title="Grouping Events" /></p>

<p>Here is the code to hook-up an event:</p>

<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>
    		this.groupingEngine.GroupAdded+=new GroupEventHandler(groupingEngine_GroupAdded);  </pre></font></p>

<p>Here is the code to unhook the event:</p>

<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>
    		this.groupingEngine.GroupAdded-=new GroupEventHandler(groupingEngine_GroupAdded);  </pre></font></p>

<p>Here is the code to add an event handler:</p>

<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>
    		private void groupingEngine_GroupAdded(object sender, GroupEventArgs e)
    		{
    			AppendOutput("GroupAdded",e);
    		}  </pre></font></p>

	<li>The second step is to initialize the event tracer with the Grid Grouping 
	control in which the events are to be traced. The event log is displayed in 
	an output window, which is <strong>ListBoxControl</strong>. The <strong>AppendOuput</strong> method of the 
	event tracer is used to send the results to the 
	list-box control for display.</li>

<p><font color="#8D2E1C"><pre>
    		this.eventTracer=new EventTracer(this.groupinggrid.Engine, this.listBox1);
    		this.eventTracer.HookEvents();  </pre></font></p>
</ul>
