<html><h1>Multicolumn Grouping Demo</h1>

<p><p>For non-nested data tables, you can use Essential Grid's grid grouping 
control to quickly provide custom views of data. This sample lets you group the data by multiple columns. 
<p></p>

<p>The group drop area can be added to the Grid Grouping control by setting the
<strong>ShowGroupDropArea</strong> property to 
<em>true</em>. The data can be grouped by any number of columns at design time. 
This can be achieved by adding column names into the <strong>GroupedColumns</strong> 
property under the <strong>TableDescriptor </strong>section.
<p>In this example, you will see an Employees table that is grouped by title and 
country.
