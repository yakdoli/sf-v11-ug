<h1>Docking Package</h1>
 
<p>The Docking Package consists of the Essential Tools docking windows architecture that allows users to add Visual Studio.NET 
type <em>dockable</em> controls to Windows Forms applications. Any control can be set as a docking window and docking layouts can be 
hosted within forms, user controls, or any derivative of the Container Control type. </p>
<p>The framework supports a complete range of 
docking behaviors such as docking-floating, nested levels, tabbed groups, state transitions, 
AutoHide, MDI child transitions, 
non-<em>dockable-</em>non-floatable options, a unique fill mode, full state persistence, Office 2007-theme support, Office 2003 support, 
dock tab and dock label alignment, and VS 2005-style docking. </p>
<p>An advanced designer allows users to harness full WYSIWYG configuration of the dock layout. </p>
<p>The different samples included in Docking Package are listed below: </p>
<p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Simple Code - </b>This sample shows you how to initialize and set up a docking layout using the docking manager's programmatic API.</li> 
<li><b>SDI Demo - </b>This sample demonstrates the docking layout in a standard form-type application. </li> 
<li><b>MDI Demo - </b>This sample demonstrates the behavior of the docking architecture in a MDI environment.</li> 
<li> <b>Window Fill - </b>This sample mainly demonstrates the usage of the 
properties <strong>DockToFill</strong> and <strong>DisallowFloating</strong>. It also describes the 
<strong>CloseEnabled</strong> property of the docking manager.

 </li>
<li><b>Drag Provider Style - </b>This sample illustrates different styles of drag providers, which will come into play when you drag a docked window. 

</li>
<li><b>Linked Managers - </b>The Linked Manager concept allows us to transfer docked windows among two or more forms or user controls.</li>
<li><b>Nested Docking Layouts - </b> This sample illustrates the implementation of nested docking layouts using user controls.</li>
<li><b>Custom Caption - </b>This sample shows you how to add custom caption buttons to the docked controls and how to customize the caption bar.
