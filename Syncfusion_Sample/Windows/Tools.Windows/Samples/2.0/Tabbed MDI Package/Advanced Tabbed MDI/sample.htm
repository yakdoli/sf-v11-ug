<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are two types of MDI children in this sample: "<strong>CustomerInfo</strong>" 
and "<strong>OrderInfo</strong>.&quot; This sample ensures that forms for these types 
are always created in their own designated tab group.</li>
	<li>The Tabbed MDI Manager allows users to programmatically control and restrict the number and 
the layout of the tab groups; it also lets users associate a form with a specific tab group. 
	</li>
	<li>This sample restricts the creation of a new child and creates a new child form once the previous one is disposed. Also, it allows users to maximize a tab group. This way users can provide a custom tabbed layout for end-users of the Tabbed MDI application.
