<html><h1>Tabbed MDI </h1>

<p>This sample illustrates how to incorporate the Tabbed MDI mode into your applications using the <strong>TabbedMDIManager</strong> class. </p>

<div align=center><img src="images/sample.png" alt="TabbedMDI Demo Image" title="" /></div>

<p>The Tabbed MDI package provides a new Tabbed MDI layout mode as an alternative to the default 
cascade and tiled modes. </p>

<p>This framework was built with great consideration for ease-of-use; it is 
intended to avoid having to modify an existing MDI application to enable the Tabbed MDI mode. With a single method call, you can switch between Tabbed and regular MDI layout modes. </p>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Multiple Tab Groups</strong></li>

<p>MDI children can be arranged horizontally or vertically, and the tab groups 
can be resized, exactly like the Visual Studio.NET IDE.</p>


<li><strong>Customized Context Menu Items</strong></li>

<p>Custom items can be added to an existing context menu item.</p>


<li><strong>Automatic State Persistence</strong></li>

<p>Tabbed MDI has full state persistence support. The Tabbed MDI Manager automatically persists 
tab groups and tab-group sizes for use across application invocations.</p>


<li><strong>Multiple Tab Alignments</strong></li>

<p>Tabbed MDI tabs can be aligned along any desired edge of the main form.</p>


<li><strong>Style Settings</strong></li>

<p>Visual styles of the MDI tabs can be changed. Some of visual styles supported are 2-D, 3-D, Office 2003, Workbook, VS 2005, One Note Style Renderer, Office 2007, Blend styles.</p>

<li><strong>Drop-Down List Buttons</strong></li>

<p>The Tabbed MDI package includes VS 2005-style drop-down list buttons, listing the MDI 
child windows and eliminating the usage of scroll buttons.</p>


<li><strong>Individual Close Buttons</strong></li>

<p>Tabbed MDI provides users with close buttons for individual tabs.</p>


<li><strong>Image Support</strong></li>

<p>Tabbed MDI uses the <strong>UseIconsInTabs</strong> property, which indicates whether to use icons in tabs 
or not.</p>


<li><strong>Tab-Group States Loading and Saving</strong>

<p>Tabbed MDI tab-group states can be saved and loaded when an application loads 
again. Load from or save the group state in the isolated storage (default 
setting) or in any <em>serializer</em> mode that is supported.</p>


<li><strong>Custom Bar Items for Tabbed MDI Manager</strong>

<p>Custom bar items can be added to the Tabbed MDI Manager by accessing the parent 
bar item instance through the&nbsp;<strong>this.tabbedMDIManager.ContextMenuItem.Items.Add(baritem)</strong> property.</p>
</p>
</ul>
