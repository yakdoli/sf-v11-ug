<h1>Tabbed MDI Package</h1>

<p>The Tabbed MDI Package provides a new tabbed MDI layout mode as an alternative to the default Cascade and Tiled modes. </p>
<p>This framework was built with great consideration for ease-of-use. It is 
intended to avoid having to modify an existing MDI application in order to enable 
the Tabbed MDI mode. With a single method call, users can switch between Tabbed and regular MDI layout modes.</p>

<p>The different samples included in Tabbed MDI Package are listed below: </p>
