<h1>XP Task Pane Demo</h1>

<p>This sample illustrates how the XP Task Pane control can be used to develop a Microsoft Word-like 
task pane.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/sample.png" alt="XPTaskPane Demo Image" title="" /></div>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<p class="style1">The XP Task Pane is a container control that can host a number of pages that can 
be browsed using a drop-down menu and the arrow buttons in the task pane's header. 
It resembles the task pane in Office XP 2002. </p>

<p class="style1">The XP Task Pane control was inspired by the Office XP Task Pane feature. The control internally uses a <b>CardLayout</b> to show one page at a time. The header panel 
also allows selecting one page at a time. The control provides complete design-time support.</p>
<p class="style1">It also supports Office 2007 visual styles including all three color schemes.</p>
