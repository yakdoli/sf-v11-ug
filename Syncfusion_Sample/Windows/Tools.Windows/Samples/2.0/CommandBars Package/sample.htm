<h1>Command Bars Package</h1>

<p>The Command Bars package comprises of the Command Bars framework. Command bars implement the framework support that is required for creating Visual Studio.NET type 
<em>dockable-</em>floatable menus and toolbars. A command bar in itself provides only the 
<em>dockable</em> host, and it is up to the user to implement the menu or toolbar that imparts the 
command bar its functionality. The Essential Tools Menus Package uses the Command Bars framework for creating XP 
menus and toolbars. </p>
