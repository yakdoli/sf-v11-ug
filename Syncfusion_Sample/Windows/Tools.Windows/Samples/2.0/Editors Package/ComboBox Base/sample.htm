<p>
The Combo Box Base is an advanced combo box control that provides many improvements over the standard 
combo box control. 
It essentially separates the edit portion from the drop-down portion, thereby making this architecture powerful and flexible. 
Users may plug-in any list control-derived class as the list for the portion of the 
combo box using the 
<strong>ListControl </strong>property.</p>
<p>
<strong>Features</strong>:</p>


<p>
<ul><li>The <strong>Text</strong> property of the Combo Box Base can be bound to 
	a database as shown below.<pre><code>

this.comboBoxBase.DataBindings.Add("Text",this.dataSet11.Products,"Discontinued");

</code></pre>

<li>Use the <strong>ListControl</strong> property to set any list control to the Combo Box Base.</p>

<p>
<li>
Any list control that is already bounded can be attached to the Combo Box Base. Use the <strong>SelectionChangeCommitted</strong> event when the text property of the Combo Box Base changes.</ul></p>
