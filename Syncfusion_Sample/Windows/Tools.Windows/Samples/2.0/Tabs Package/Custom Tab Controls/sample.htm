<h1>Custom Tab Control </h1>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<p>This sample illustrates the implementation of a custom tab control<strong>
</strong>using an owner-draw technique and deriving from default rendering-base classes.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/sample.PNG" alt="CustomTabControl Demo Image" title="" /></div>

<p><strong>Interactive Features: </strong></p>
<p>In Yahoo Messenger(R), the active tab is the only one that has a border 
around it; the rest are borderless. This is achieved by setting the <strong>TabStyle</strong> to "<strong>3D</strong>" (<strong>typeof(TabRenderer3D)</strong>), handling the
<strong>DrawItem</strong> event, delegating the
background and interior drawing to the default drawing logic, and delegating the border drawing logic to the default drawing logic, 
but only if the corresponding tab is active.</p>
