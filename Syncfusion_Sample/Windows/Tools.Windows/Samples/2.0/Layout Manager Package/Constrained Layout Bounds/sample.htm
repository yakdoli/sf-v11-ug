<h1>Constrained Layout Bounds </h1>

<p>Layout managers typically lay out child controls within a container's client rectangle<span class="style1">—</span>except 
for a flow layout, which might position the child controls beyond the client 
rectangle.</p>

<p>This sample shows how the layout manager is better at laying out child 
controls than the client rectangle.</p>

<div align=center><img src="images/sample.PNG" alt="Constraint Layout Managers Demo Image" title="" /></div>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The minimum layout width and height are restricted to 300 and 200, respectively. When the form is resized beyond that, 
a scroll bar appears.</li>
	<li>This sample uses a grid layout manager for illustration; however, the premise 
illustrated here applies to any layout manager.</li>
</ul>
