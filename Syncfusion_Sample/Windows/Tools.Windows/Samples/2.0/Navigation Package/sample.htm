<h1>Navigation Package</h1>

<p>The Navigation package<strong> </strong>includes controls<span class="style1">—</span>such as the Group Bar, Group View, and the XP TaskBar<span class="style1">—</span>that are primarily used for implementing command lists where each command is represented by an image or text. Popular examples of command lists are the Microsoft Outlook Bar, VS .NET Toolbox, Windows 2000/XP Folder Selectors, and the Windows XP Task Bar.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A group bar implements a tab-type container that can serve as a host for a 
collection of group views or other Windows Forms controls. A group view is an extensively 
customizable list-type control capable of cloning popular command interfaces. The XP TaskBar 
can be used to display standard command items or as a container that can host several other controls. </p>
