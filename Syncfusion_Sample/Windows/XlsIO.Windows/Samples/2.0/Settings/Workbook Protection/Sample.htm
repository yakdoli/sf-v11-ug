<h1>Workbook Protection</h1>
<p>You can lock the structure of a workbook, which prevents users from adding or
deleting worksheets or from displaying hidden worksheets. You can also prevent
users from changing the size or position of worksheet windows. Workbook
structure and window protection apply to the entire workbook.</p>

<p>To protect a workbook, point to <strong>Protection</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, and then click
<strong>Protect</strong> <strong>Workbook</strong>.
You can choose which elements you want to protect (workbook structure, windows, or both) by selecting or clearing the corresponding check boxes.</p>

<p>Below is an image showing workbook protection in Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/sample.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div></p>

<p style="font-size:large">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting a workbook with a password</li>
<li>Protecting a window or structure from modification</li>
<li>Removing protection of a workbook with a password</li>

</ul>
<p style="font-size:large">Interactive Features:</p>
<ul>

<li>Click <b>Protect Workbook</b> to protect a workbook with the password "syncfusion" and view the document.</li>
<li>Click <b>Unprotect Workbook</b> to remove protection in the workbook with the password "syncfusion" and view the document.</li>

</ul>

<p>Below is an image of the output.</p>
<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/sample1.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div></p>

<p>You can see from the output that the window and structure of the file cannot be modified
and no new sheets can be added or moved.</p>

<p>Here is a code snippet:</p>
<p><pre>
//Protect Workbook.
workbook.Protect(true, true, "syncfusion");

//Unprotect workbook.
// Opening a Existing(Protected) Worksheet from a Workbook
IWorkbook workbook = application.Workbooks.Open(@"ProtectedWorkbook.xls");

//Unprotecting( unlocking) Workbook using the Password
workbook.Unprotect("syncfusion");
</pre></p>
