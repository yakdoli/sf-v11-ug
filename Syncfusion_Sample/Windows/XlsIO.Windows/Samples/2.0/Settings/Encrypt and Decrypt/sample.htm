<h1>Advanced Encrypt and Decrypt</h1>

<p>This sample focuses on the encryption and decryption of an Excel 2007 workbook using Essential XlsIO.</p>

<p>Encryption is a method of protecting workbook data.&nbsp; It is based on a 
password that converts the data into a form that cannot be understood; it also
restricts anonymous users from accessing a document. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form so that data can be read from the workbook.</p>
<p class="style1">A password for encrypting a workbook can be set in Microsoft Excel 2007 through 
the <strong>Office Menu</strong>-><strong>Prepare</strong>-><strong>Encrypt Document</strong> command.</p>


<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/Encrypt.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div></p>

</br>
<p class="style1">Note:  Password protection of a workbook file is different from the workbook structure and window protection you can set in the <strong>Review</strong>-><strong>Protect Workbook</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:large">Features:</p>
<ul>
