<h1>Formatting</h1>
<p> The cell format in a spreadsheet dictates how data will be displayed, whether the cell will have borders, and other information. All of the cell formatting commands can be reached through a 
context menu by right clicking 
on a cell and selecting the &quot;Format Cells&quot; menu entry. You can also 
apply this formatting based on conditions called "Conditional Formatting." These can be accessed through 
the format menu in Excel.</p>
