    Range Manipulation</h1>
<p>
    This sample demonstrates Essential XlsIO's support for manipulating a range of cells.</p>
<p>
    A range is a group or block of cells in a worksheet that have been selected or highlighted.
    Normally, there is only one cell in a worksheet with a black outline. Ranges are
    identified by cell references or addresses of the cells in the upper-left and lower-right
    corners of the range. These two references are separated by a colon (:), which
    tells Excel to include all the cells between these start and end points. An adjacent
    cell's range can be depicted as &quot;A5:F10.&quot;</p>
<p>
    Essential XlsIO provides various ways to manipulate ranges. </p>
<p style="font-size:large">Features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Named Range Usage</b></li>
    <p>
        Named ranges are a powerful tool in Excel that allows you to assign a meaningful
        name to a single cell or a range of cells. For example, you can assign the name
        "Cell1" to cell "C1" and then use the name "Cell1" anytime you would normally use
        the cell C1. This allows the user to name a collection of cells or a single cell,
        making it more readable.</p>
    <p>
        Below are images in Excel for creating named ranges.

        </p>
        <div align="Center">
            <img src="images/range2.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div>
        <li><b>IRange interface usage</b></li>
        <p>
            This is the common interface used to work with a range.&nbsp; It allows the user
            to perform a number of operations, like copying a range of cells from one row or
            column to another, merging cells, applying formats, assigning text or various formats,
            and deleting a range of cells.</p>
        <li><b>IMigrantRange interface usage</b></li>
        <p>
            This is an optimal way for writing simple strings and strings with styles, which
            improves performance.</p>
        <li><b>AutoFilter</b></li>
        <p>
            This is a method of <em>sub-setting</em> data, which simply removes unwanted data
            from view. This allows the user to view selected records based on certain constraints,
            reducing the time it takes to search for a record in a large report. This sample
            also demonstrates AutoFilter usage in Essential XlsIO.</p>
    </p>

      <p>
        Below is the image&nbsp; in Excel for creating an AutoFilter.</p>
    <div align="Center">
        <img src="images/autofilter.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div>
</ul>

 <p style="font-size:large">Interactive Features:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Choose one from the options--Excel 2003,Excel 2007,Excel 2010--to generate 
a document in Excel 2003, Excel 2007,Excel 2010 respectively.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Create</b> to generate and view the document.</li>
	<li>All features in the preceding list are illustrated in this file.</li>
</ul>

    Below is the image of the output.</p>
<p>
    <div align="Center">
        <img src="images/rangemanip.png" alt="XlsIO" title="" /></div>
</p>
<p>
    Here is a code snippet:</p>
<pre>

//Creates an AutoFilter in the specified range.
sheet.AutoFilters.FilterRange = sheet.Range["B14:E91" ];

//Copies range of cells from source to destination with the styles preserved.
source.CopyTo(des,ExcelCopyRangeOptions.None|ExcelCopyRangeOptions.CopyStyles);

//Defining the Range
IName lname1 = sheet.Names.Add("One");

//Another way to refer range of cells.
lname1.RefersToRange = sheet.Range[98,4,98,5];

//Merges the range of cells
sheet.Range["One"].Merge();

//Creates migrant range and assigns value.
IMigrantRange migrantRange = sheet.MigrantRange;
migrantRange.ResetRowColumn(6,4);
migrantRange.Value = "INVENTORY REPORT";

</pre>
