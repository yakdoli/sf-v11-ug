<h1>Mail Merge</h1>

<p>Mail merge is a word-processing feature that can be used to create many documents at once where only certain portions of each document vary. This helps simplify repetitive tasks. </p>
<p>This section contains the below samples.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Letter Format</b>-This samples demonstrates Essential DocIO's support for generating 
a report in a letter format.</li>
<li><b>Employee Report</b>-This samples demonstrates Essential DocIO's support for generating 
an employee report.</li>
<li><b>Mail Merge Event</b>-This samples demonstrates Essential DocIO's support for 
a mail merge event.</li>
<li><b>Nested Mail Merge</b>-This samples demonstrates Essential DocIO's support for 
a nested mail merge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before looking at the samples in this section, let's discuss how a document with 
a merge field is created and how it works with DocIO.</p>

<p>Mail merge primarily consists of two files, the main document or template and the 
merge fields. The template contains information that will remain the same in each record, and the 
merge fields are placeholders for the information that will change the template 
document according to records from the data source. This includes two main steps; 
they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Merge field creation</strong><p>-Create a new Word document with merge fields. This can be done by inserting merge fields through <strong>Insert--> Fields--> Merge.</strong></p>
<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/createf.png" alt="DocIO" title="" /></div></p>
<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/createf1.png" alt="DocIO" title="" /></div></p>

<p>Provide the merge-field name and text to be inserted before and after the field. 
</p>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong>The merge-field name should match the field name of the data source.</p>
<p><div align = "Center"><img src="images/create.png" alt="DocIO" title="" /></div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Data Binding</strong></li>

<p>Essential DocIO provides support for merging data from various sources, such 
as a data set, data reader, data table, or data view. The data from the data source is merged into the template document based on the field name of the data source, which matches the field name of the 
merge field.</p></ol>
