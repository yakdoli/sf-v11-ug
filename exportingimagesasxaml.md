#### Exporting Images as XAML {#exporting-images-as-xaml style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

 

Vector Images can be exported as a xaml file, by using the Vector Image utility. These xaml files can be merged into the application, so that you can use the icons in the application by referring the Resource Key. The selected image will be displayed on the right pane. Using the Sliders, the images can be resized as expected. The resized image will not deviate from its clarity.
