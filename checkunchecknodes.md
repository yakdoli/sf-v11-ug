#### Check/Uncheck nodes {#checkuncheck-nodes style="tab-stops: 0pt"}

The check option is provided in such a way that on selecting the parent node, its corresponding child nodes are automatically selected. If a leaf node is selected, it doesn't affect others since it's the end node of a tree.

The uncheck option is provided in such a way that on deselecting the parent node its corresponding child nodes are automatically deselected as well as on deselecting all the child nodes, its corresponding parent node is automatically deselected.
